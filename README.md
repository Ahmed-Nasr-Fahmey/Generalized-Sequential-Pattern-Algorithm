# Generalized Sequential Pattern Algorithm

The Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP) algorithm is utilized for mining frequent sequential patterns from sequential transactional databases. It extends the Apriori algorithm, which is used for mining frequent itemsets, to sequential data.

A sequential pattern is composed of items or events that are ordered by transaction time or sequence ID. The primary objective is to discover all patterns that surpass a specified minimum support threshold.

## Algorithm Overview

The GSP algorithm involves several key steps:

1. **Scan the Database**: Scan the database to identify singleton itemsets that exceed the minimum support threshold.

2. **Generate Candidate 2-Sequences**: Generate candidate 2-sequences by joining frequent 1-sequences using an Apriori join.

3. **Count Support for Candidates**: Scan the database to count support for the candidate 2-sequences and identify frequent 2-sequences.

4. **Iterative Process**: Repeat the process of generating candidates and counting support for sequences of length k by joining frequent (k-1)-sequences, and scanning the database to find frequent k-sequences.

5. **Termination**: Terminate the process when no further candidates are generated or when the database is exhausted.

The GSP algorithm utilizes pruning techniques to reduce the search space. It avoids generating supersets of infrequent sequences. The algorithm performs joins level-wise in a breadth-first manner to ensure completeness.

## Benefits

- **Useful Patterns Discovery**: GSP helps discover useful sequential patterns in various fields such as market basket analysis, web logs, and bioinformatics.

- **Support Count**: The algorithm provides support counts along with the frequent sequences, which aids in understanding the significance of discovered patterns.

By applying the GSP algorithm, you can uncover meaningful insights from sequential transactional data, making it valuable for uncovering hidden trends and patterns.
