# Generalized Sequential Pattern Algorithm
 The GSP algorithm is used for mining frequent sequential patterns from sequential transactional databases. It is an extension of the Apriori algorithm for frequent itemset mining to sequential data.  A sequential pattern consists of items/events ordered by transaction time or sequence ID. The goal is to find all patterns that exceed a minimum support threshold.
